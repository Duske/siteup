# siteup [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Duske/siteup.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/Duske/siteup)

## What is siteup?
An opinionated and simple site-generator. It helps you to quickly kick-off a page or template.
The most common use case in my experience is to generate a working prototype in HTML/CSS/JS, which is ported into a CMS later on.

## What's included
* Handlebars for HTML compilation
* Bower package management with wiredep
* SASS compilation with sourcemaps
* Build process to make the site production-ready
* Gulp as build system
* BrowserSync as a live-server while developing
* ESLint
* ES2015 transpilation for written JS, supporting ES2015 modules
* Test cases for gulpfile configuration/tasks

## TODO
- [ ] Testing Setup for JS
- [ ] Restructure existing SASS configuration/directories
